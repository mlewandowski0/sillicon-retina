# Fig. "comparison_intensity": FireNet intensity reconstruction from DVS vs Retina
# events on FILM-upsampled ECOCO (src/neural_network/data/upsampled_{train,validation}).
# These configs use the legacy `out_sigmoid` key (accepted by the current code) and
# add_bn=false, so the network is the same as in the original runs. The run-to-config mapping
# for this figure was not recorded; the configs below are the ones used by the
# original job scripts (scripts/history/jobs/job3.sh). The retina runs in the
# figure vary sequence length / burn-in (see legend), set in the config.
